My fourth project consisted of using the MEAN stack development technologies. With a non relational database of Mongodb, I was able to come up with an application that incorporated the Spitcast, Google, and Weather Underground API to allow specific data to be used within my own application. 


## How I came about this idea 

I used to love being apart of the surf community when I went to college at UCSB so I decided to make an app for my friends who happen to be surfers.
